Today, I started making my own cryptocurrency using the Solana token. However, yesterday (April 26, 2025), I attempted to create my own cryptocurrency on Kali Linux. I tried to customize the coin's name and metadata, but I encountered some Docker errors. As a result, I decided to switch to Ubuntu for this task. I accessed my dual-booted Windows system and launched WSL to continue my cryptocurrency development.

The main code for my minting process, which I describe to as the "Dad Code," I wrote. I'm currently working on the Devnet rather than the Main net, but the procedure should be same for both. My currency is called Beard currency, and the profile image looks like "AS." I stored my profile image and the metadata.json file  on Pinata Cloud. After completing these procedures, I used [explorer.solana.com](http://explorer.solana.com/) to view my bitcoin and monitor my progress.

Additionally, I customized my WSL Ubuntu terminal with Zsh and changed its colors to match the original Ubuntu terminal aesthetics. After a Windows update, my laptop prompted me to restart. When I returned to the Windows lock screen, the display color was normal; however, upon logging in, it switched to night light mode.

To address this, I entered repair mode and installed "Splendid" from the Microsoft Store, however it did not work properly owing to compatibility issues with my current screen settings. I then downloaded the Intel Graphics Command Center, which allowed me to change the color theme, and everything is now operating properly.

After all of this, I saved my bitcoin information in Notion's Private Universe (which I created). This is my diary of today's activities and learning experiences.
